# [MILLER MUSCLE MANSION ](https://zakenaio.github.io/ci2023dfs-p1-site-main)


I aimed to disrupt the typical gym website aesthetics characterized by harsh edges, opting for a softer, rounded, and more welcoming vibe. Employing muted earth tones and subtle shifts in the color palette, the goal was to create an environment that embraces visitors. This approach sought to redefine fitness as inclusive and less intimidating, making it more appealing to a broader audience by avoiding excessive aggression in design.

## UX


I chose a streamlined one-page structure for the website, positioning the navigation under the logo/header at the top. To ensure adaptability across resolutions, the logo and navigation dynamically adjust in both size and position. On mobile devices, they center over the content for a clean and accessible layout, while on desktops, they scale slightly larger and shift to the right for optimized visibility and user experience. This responsive design approach aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly interface, accommodating various devices and screen sizes.


### Colour Scheme

### Typography

**Trebuchet MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans, Arial, sans-serif.**

Trebuchet MS Trebuchet MS has a modern and elegant appearance, making it suitable for contemporary websites. Readable at Small Sizes: It maintains readability even at smaller font sizes, ensuring a positive user experience on various devices.

## Wireframes

My initial idea deviates slightly from the final result, but its close. 
I struggled with the right feel, so i made one single section for 
every part, instead of having h2 in one, content in one underneath. 
I believe it was the right choice, simpler, easier on the eyes.

## Features

![Semi-nav](resources/nav-transp.png)

Semi-transparent navigation buttons enhance user experience by providing subtle visibility without obstructing content, fostering an elegant design. This promotes intuitive navigation, maintaining a balance between aesthetics and functionality for a seamless browsing experience.

![Rounded Overlay](resources/rounded-overlay.png)
![Rounded Overlay](resources/cohesive.png)

Integrating rounded sections and overlapping content with section dividers on a website achieves a dynamic and modern design. The rounded sections soften visuals, adding an inviting feel, while overlapping content enhances continuity, guiding users through a seamless and engaging browsing experience. This cohesive approach elevates overall aesthetics and fosters positive user interaction.

![Side Overlay](resources/over-blobs.png)

By placing side images and content in separate sections slightly above the main content, all with rounded corners, we maintain a unified and modern design. This consistent look enhances user experience, providing a visually appealing and approachable website layout.
