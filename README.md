My project for CI-FSD-2023-no. 
I wanted to challange the regular gym sites with its rough and hard edges and play with a more rounded and inviting feel. By using muted, earth colours and only slight deviations in colour palette i try to embrace the visitor.

#### Wireframe 
My initial idea deviates slightly from the final result, but its close. 
I struggled with the right feel, so i made a one single section for 
every part, instead of having h2 in one, content in one underneath. 
I believe it was the right choice, simpler easier on the eyes.

### Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mainly VS code, i found Codeanywhere to be slow, and unreliable.
Illustror for the wireframe. 

### REFS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
W3 School have been a real goldmine. 
I have used, and modifed code for my buttons by adding backdround, and hover slide colors. 

Yoga events are a version of the one from Code Institutes Love Running project.
