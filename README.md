# [MILLER MUSCLE MANSION ](https://zakenaio.github.io/ci2023dfs-p1-site-main)

I wanted to challange the regular gym sites with its rough and hard edges and play with a more rounded and inviting feel. 
By using muted, earth colours and only slight deviations in colour palette to embrace the visitor. 

The purpose was to make fitness more appealing to everyone, without being to aggressive.

## UX

I decided to go with a one page structure with nav at the top under the logo/header. 
Logo and nav changes size and position dynamicly depending on resolution. 
Center over content for mobile, and larger slightly to the right on desktop. 


### Colour Scheme
![Colour Schemes](resources/colours.png "Colour Schemes")

I wanted muted, earth colors for 

- `#3a3a3a` used for primary text.
- `#4A4A4F` used for primaty highlight.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.
- `#009FE3` used for third highlights.



- `#3a3a3a` used for navigation background.
- `#4A4A4F` used for navigation text.
- `#009FE3` used for navigation border.
- `#009FE3` used for navigation hover.



- `#D5D5D5` used for home/welcome background.
- `#efefef` used for home/welcome rounded section.
- `#4E4E4E` used for equipment background.
- `#d2d2d2` used for qeuipment rounded section.
- `#9A9C8C` used for yoga background.
- `#efefef` used for yoga rounded section.
- `#928977` used for member background.
- `#ececec` used for member rounded section.



- `#2b2b2b` used for dark blobs.

## Wireframes

My initial idea deviates slightly from the final result, but its close. 
I struggled with the right feel, so i made one single section for 
every part, instead of having h2 in one, content in one underneath. 
I believe it was the right choice, simpler, easier on the eyes.

## Features

![Semi-nav](resources/nav-transp.png)

Semi-transparent nav should stand out, without being to intrusive. 

![Rounded Overlay](resources/rounded-overlay.png)
![Rounded Overlay](resources/cohesive.png)

Content sections overlap the parallaxed section deviders for a cohesive feel.  

![Side Overlay](resources/over-blobs.png)

Side images and content got their separate sections slightly ontop of the main content with the same rounded corners to keep the feel.
