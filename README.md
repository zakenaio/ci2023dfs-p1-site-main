# Miller Musle Mansion.

My project for CI-FSD-2023-no. 
I wanted to challange the regular gym sites with its rough and hard edges and play with a more rounded and inviting feel. 
By using muted, earth colours and only slight deviations in colour palette to embrace the visitor. 

The purpose was to make fitness more appealing to everyone, without being to aggressive.

### Header
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted the header to be relatively powerfull. The hight of the header where important to get right. 
On mobile with the large centered text where a good compliment to the bigger bolder for desktop. 

### Navigation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy to understand navigation, with slight high lighting on hover for visual feedback without being intrusive. 

### Sections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every section got its own background colour for an easy overview. Rounded borders on content sections 
with a slight shadow do make it stand a bit more without being distracting from the the content. 

Dividing each section with a parallaxed image to make sure every section got its on spotlight. 
There should be no doubt to where you are on the site. A nod back to the choice of different colors. 

Some images and important information got its own sections, to left or right slightly over the main content sections for a 
better overview. Some images hides on mobile to make it less cluttred so it wont spam the visitor with images.

#### Wireframe 
My initial idea deviates slightly from the final result, but its close. 
I struggled with the right feel, so i made a one single section for 
every part, instead of having h2 in one, content in one underneath. 
I believe it was the right choice, simpler easier on the eyes.

### Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mainly VS code, i found Codeanywhere to be slow, and unreliable.
Illustror for the wireframe. 

### REFS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
W3 School have been a real goldmine. 
I have used, and modifed code for my buttons by adding backdround, and hover slide colors. 

Top button on scroll also from w3s
